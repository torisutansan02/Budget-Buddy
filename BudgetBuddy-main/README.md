## Build
- Install VSCode IDE or an IDE of your choice.

- Create a folder, open the folder, and open a terminal on your IDE.
- Clone the repository.

## Installation
- After cloning the repository, open a new terminal.
- Run the command `cd backend` and then run `npm i`.
- Open a new separate terminal.
- Run the command `cd frontend` and then run `npm i`.
- Ensure you have a .env file in the backend.
- The .env file needs values of PORT=4000, MONGO_URI=your_uri, SECRET=your_secret_key.
- Create a MongoDB cluster and get a connection string for your URI.
- Run the command below to create a secret key.
- `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"`
- You have successfully installed the dependencies and the app is ready to start.

## Usage
- After installing the dependencies, remain on the frontend and backend.
- Run the command `node server.js` while in the directory backend.
- You should be on PORT 4000 and connected to MongoDB successfully.
- Run the command `npm start` in the directory frontend.
- The webpage should successfully have all correct dependencies and you should be running on http://localhost:3000/
- From here, sign up and create an account. By signing up, you have access to all protected routes.
- You can now use the Budget Buddy web application.

- We are using VSCode as our IDE and NPM as our package manager.

Frontend
- HTML provides the skeletal structure of our project, where CSS offers the visual styles and layout.
- React allows for handling dynamic user interactions, and rendering complex UI elements. Its' component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Backend
- Node.js is an efficient and scalable platform for building server-side applications. It handles server-side logic, business operations, and database interactions. The asynchronous nature of Node.js will support high throughput and fast response times.
- Forms and file systems are integrated and tested through User Input, MongoDB, and Express.js.
