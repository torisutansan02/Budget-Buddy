## Build

- Install `IDE` of your choice.

- Clone the repository.
- Open the repository on your IDE.
- Refer to `frontend` and `backend` directories for:
  - Installing dependencies and development commands.

## Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- Open an IDE like VSCode, and open the folder with this repository.
- Run a new terminal, and use a CLI like Git Bash.
- Ensure you have three terminals open.
  - Change directory to `frontend` in one terminal.
  - Change directory to `backend` in another terminal.
  - Keep one terminal in the outermost directory.
- Env File Setup (Frontend):
  - In the `frontend` directory, create files `.env` and `.env.production`.
    - `.env` contains `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000`.
    - `.env.production` contains `VITE_API_URL={SECRET URL}`.
- Env File Setup (Backend):
  - In the `backend` directory, create file `.env`.
    - `.env` contains `PORT=4000`, `MONGO_URI={SECRET URI}`, and `SECRET={SECRET KEY}`.
    - Run the command below to generate a secret key:
      - `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"`
- Afterwards, refer to the README files to install dependencies for the frontend and backend directories.
- You should now be able to run the development server for both the frontend and backend.
